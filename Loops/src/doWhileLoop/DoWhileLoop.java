//  the diff. b/w while and do while loop is that in while loop it checks the condn. firsts and is it is true it enters teh loop
//  but in do while loop it first enters teh loop and is the condn is true then it stays in loop in loop and if tt is false then 
//  it comes out of the loop i.e. it enters teh atleast one time.
